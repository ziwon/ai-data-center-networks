# Repository Guidelines

## Diagram and SVG Style

When creating or updating SVG diagrams in this repository, use the shared editorial diagram style unless a local file clearly uses a different established style.

### Palette

- Background: `#F3EFE7` or `#F5F1EA`
- Primary text: `#050505`
- Secondary text: `#6F6A63`
- Accent red/orange: `#D9392E`
- Main line: `#111111`
- Subtle border/grid: `#D8D1C7`

### Layout

- Prefer clean technical diagrams over slide-like hero layouts.
- Do not include a large title/subtitle inside the SVG when the README already introduces the figure.
- Keep diagrams flow-oriented, with thin line boxes and minimal filled color.
- Use accent red only for the most important warning, sync, loss, bottleneck, or critical path.
- Prefer whitespace, alignment, and line hierarchy over colored cards.
- Keep labels inside the viewBox; verify text is not clipped.
- Use large, bold text only for key numbers or core messages.
- Use small gray text for secondary explanations.

### Implementation

- SVGs should be hand-editable and use inline `<style>` classes.
- Avoid heavy shadows, gradients, decorative blobs, or multicolor palettes.
- Validate SVGs with:

```bash
xmllint --noout path/to/file.svg
```

- Before finishing, run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Mermaid Diagram Style

When creating or updating Mermaid diagrams in repository READMEs, apply the same editorial diagram style used for SVGs. Mermaid diagrams should feel like lightweight technical figures, not colorful slide graphics.

### Mermaid Palette

Use the shared palette through `classDef` declarations inside each Mermaid block:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Primary concept] --> B[Intermediate step]
    B --> C[Critical output]
    B --> D[Secondary note]

    classDef primary fill:#F5F1EA,stroke:#111111,stroke-width:1.4px,color:#050505
    classDef secondary fill:#F3EFE7,stroke:#D8D1C7,stroke-width:1.2px,color:#050505
    classDef note fill:#F5F1EA,stroke:#D8D1C7,stroke-width:1px,color:#6F6A63
    classDef accent fill:#F5F1EA,stroke:#D9392E,stroke-width:2px,color:#050505
    class A primary
    class B secondary
    class C accent
    class D note
```

### Mermaid Layout

- Prefer `flowchart LR` for pipelines and generation flows; prefer `flowchart TB` for taxonomies, prompt structures, and stacked model families.
- Keep node labels short. Use `<br/>` for a controlled second line instead of long single-line labels.
- Use `primary` for the input, root concept, or final core object.
- Use `secondary` for ordinary processing steps.
- Use `note` for examples, caveats, side outputs, or supporting details.
- Use `accent` sparingly for the critical path, bottleneck, selected expert, final selected answer, unsafe/invalid path, or main trade-off.
- Avoid more than four visual classes in a Mermaid block unless the local diagram genuinely needs more.
- Do not use Mermaid theme directives, gradients, icons, emojis, or multicolor class palettes unless a local file already established that style.
- Keep arrows simple. Use dashed arrows only for feedback loops, optional links, or explanatory references.

### Mermaid Implementation

- Put `classDef` declarations inside each Mermaid block so the diagram remains portable when copied into another README.
- Reuse class names consistently: `primary`, `secondary`, `note`, `accent`.
- Assign classes explicitly with `class ...` lines rather than relying on default Mermaid styling.
- For lecture notes, prefer Mermaid for conceptual flow and taxonomy diagrams; use hand-editable SVG for dense architecture, matrix, cache, or routing diagrams where precise alignment matters.
- Before finishing, run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Practical Tips and Notes Sections

When adding a `Practical Tips and Notes` section to a chapter README, keep it clearly separate from the book summary.

### Purpose

- Use this section for field-tested operational guidance, implementation heuristics, and common failure modes that are relevant to the chapter but not necessarily stated in the source book.
- Do not present these notes as if they came from the book unless the book explicitly says them.
- Prefer practical judgment: what to measure, what can go wrong, what to baseline, and what trade-off to verify.

### Structure

- Add `Practical Tips and Notes` as a normal top-level section near the end of the chapter, usually after validation/checklist material and before roadmap/summary material.
- Add it to the table of contents.
- Use short `###` subsections with descriptive names instead of making every item a GitHub admonition.
- Keep the main content as normal paragraphs or compact tables.
- Use a final quick-reference table when it helps map symptoms to first checks.

### GitHub Admonitions

- Use `> [!TIP]` only for a small number of immediately actionable practices.
- Use `> [!WARNING]` only for risks that can cause incorrect conclusions, bad placement, data loss, wasted hardware, or major performance regressions.
- Avoid wrapping the whole section, or most of the section, in `TIP`, `NOTE`, or `WARNING` blocks. Too many admonitions make the section hard to scan.
- Prefer normal prose for ordinary explanatory notes.

### Content Style

- Keep tips concrete and measurable. Mention tools, metrics, commands, or observable symptoms when useful.
- Distinguish utilization from goodput, capacity from bandwidth, and allocation from topology.
- When discussing external images or references, prefer official sources for embedded images. Use third-party articles as additional references unless there is a strong reason to embed them.
- If a referenced image is similar but not the same system, add an explicit note explaining the difference.

## Git Commits

Use Git Conventional Commits for commit messages.

Examples:

```text
feat: add week03 tensor parallelism diagrams
fix: adjust SVG label positions
docs: translate week03 README to Korean
style: apply repository SVG diagram palette
chore: update repository guidelines
```

Prefer concise scopes when useful:

```text
docs(week03): add practical training notes
fix(svg): prevent QKV label clipping
```
