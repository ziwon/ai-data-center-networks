## Goal

This chapter introduces the mental model of **AI Systems Performance Engineering**.

The core idea is:

> AI performance engineering is not about making GPUs look busy.
> It is about maximizing useful work — goodput — across hardware, software, runtime, network, storage, scheduler, and application layers.

Chapter 1 sets the foundation for the whole book:

* AI systems are full-stack systems.
* Performance bottlenecks can appear at any layer.
* Raw GPU utilization is not enough.
* Goodput is the real target.
* Optimization must be driven by profiling, not intuition.
* Hardware, software, and algorithms must be codesigned.

## Core Message

AI systems performance engineering is the discipline of answering three questions:

1. **Where is the bottleneck?**
2. **How do we measure it?**
3. **Which layer should we fix?**

The important shift is from:

```text
"GPU utilization is high, so the system is healthy."
```

to:

```text
"How much of the system's capacity is doing useful training or inference work?"
```

This is why Chapter 1 introduces **goodput**, **mechanical sympathy**, and **hardware-software-algorithm codesign** early.

## AI Systems Performance Engineer

An AI Systems Performance Engineer sits between several domains.

```

The role is not just “GPU administrator” or “ML engineer.”

It combines:

| Area                | Responsibility                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Benchmarking        | Measure throughput, latency, memory usage, scaling efficiency      |
| Profiling           | Identify bottlenecks using system and GPU profilers                |
| Debugging           | Trace performance regressions to root cause                        |
| Optimization        | Improve kernels, runtime, data pipeline, communication, scheduling |
| Scaling             | Move from single GPU to multi-GPU, multinode, multirack systems    |
| Resource efficiency | Improve performance per dollar and performance per watt            |
| Reproducibility     | Make benchmark results repeatable and comparable                   |

## Why Goodput Matters

Goodput means **useful throughput**.

Raw throughput asks:

```text
How much work appears to be happening?
```

Goodput asks:

```text
How much useful model progress is actually happening?
```

Examples of non-useful work:

* GPU waiting for dataloader
* GPU waiting for NCCL synchronization
* excessive CPU-GPU memory copy
* failed job restart
* suboptimal kernel launch overhead
* communication bubble in pipeline parallelism
* request queueing delay in inference serving
* KV cache eviction or recomputation

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    classDef useful fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b
    classDef waste fill:#fff1f2,stroke:#e11d48,color:#7f1d1d
    classDef total fill:#eef6ff,stroke:#2563eb,color:#0f172a

    TOTAL[Total GPU Cluster Time]:::total

    USEFUL[Useful Work<br/>forward/backward<br/>tokens generated<br/>requests completed]:::useful

    W1[Data loading wait]:::waste
    W2[NCCL communication wait]:::waste
    W3[Kernel launch overhead]:::waste
    W4[OOM / restart / preemption]:::waste
    W5[Storage checkpoint stall]:::waste

    TOTAL --> USEFUL
    TOTAL --> W1
    TOTAL --> W2
    TOTAL --> W3
    TOTAL --> W4
    TOTAL --> W5
```

A simplified goodput view:

```text
Goodput = Useful completed work / End-to-end elapsed time
```

For training:

```text
Goodput = useful tokens or samples processed per second
```

For inference:

```text
Goodput = completed requests or generated tokens per second under SLO
```

The key point:

> GPU utilization can be high while goodput is low.

Example:

| Situation                                          | GPU Utilization |       Goodput | Likely Bottleneck             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------: | ------------: | ----------------------------- |
| GPU busy but waiting on all-reduce                 |            High |           Low | Network / NCCL                |
| GPU periodically idle before each batch            | Low or unstable |           Low | CPU / dataloader / storage    |
| GPU memory nearly full, KV cache eviction frequent |            High |           Low | Memory / serving scheduler    |
| p99 latency high despite good average throughput   |            High | Low under SLO | Application / batching policy |
| training job restarts often                        |        Variable |           Low | Reliability / orchestration   |

## Benchmarking and Profiling

Chapter 1 emphasizes that performance work should be **profile-driven**.

The workflow should be:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef step fill:#eef6ff,stroke:#2563eb,color:#0f172a
    classDef decision fill:#fff7ed,stroke:#ea580c,color:#7c2d12
    classDef output fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b

    A[Define workload]:::step
    B[Run baseline benchmark]:::step
    C[Collect profiling data]:::step
    D{Find bottleneck}:::decision
    E[Apply targeted optimization]:::step
    F[Re-run benchmark]:::step
    G[Compare before/after]:::output
    H[Automate regression test]:::output

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H
    G --> C
```

Bad optimization style:

```text
"I changed this and it feels faster."
```

Good optimization style:

```text
"Before: 1,200 tokens/s, p99 900 ms.
After: 1,580 tokens/s, p99 710 ms.
Profiler shows NCCL wait reduced from 27% to 12%."
```

### Benchmarking targets

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Training               | samples/sec, tokens/sec, step time | GPU util, NCCL time, dataloader wait, checkpoint time |
| Inference              | tokens/sec, requests/sec           | TTFT, TPOT, p95/p99 latency, queue time               |
| Distributed training   | scaling efficiency                 | all-reduce time, network bandwidth, straggler ratio   |
| Storage-heavy training | data pipeline throughput           | IOPS, read BW, dataloader latency                     |
| LLM serving            | SLO-compliant throughput           | KV cache usage, batch size, decode latency            |

## Mechanical Sympathy

Mechanical sympathy means:

> Understand how the machine works, then design software and algorithms that cooperate with it.

For AI systems, the “machine” includes:

* GPU SMs
* Tensor Cores
* HBM
* L2 cache
* CPU NUMA topology
* PCIe / NVLink / NVSwitch
* RDMA NICs
* storage hierarchy
* CUDA runtime
* PyTorch execution model
* Kubernetes scheduler placement

```mermaid

    classDef machine fill:#eef6ff,stroke:#2563eb,color:#0f172a
    classDef symptom fill:#fff1f2,stroke:#e11d48,color:#7f1d1d
    classDef fix fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b

    HBM[HBM bandwidth limit]:::machine
    ATT[Attention reads/writes too much memory]:::symptom
    FA[FlashAttention / memory tiling]:::fix

    NV[Limited interconnect bandwidth]:::machine
    COMM[AllReduce or MoE expert traffic stalls]:::symptom
    OVERLAP[Overlap communication and computation]:::fix

    CPU[CPU NUMA / dataloader overhead]:::machine
    STARVE[GPU starved for batches]:::symptom
    PIN[CPU pinning / memory pinning / prefetch]:::fix

    HBM --> ATT --> FA
    NV --> COMM --> OVERLAP
    CPU --> STARVE --> PIN
```

Examples:

| Hardware Reality                              | Performance Problem                   | Mechanically Sympathetic Fix                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| HBM is fast but limited                       | attention moves too much data         | FlashAttention, MLA                              |
| NVLink is faster than IB                      | cross-node communication is expensive | keep traffic intra-node/intra-rack when possible |
| Tensor Cores prefer specific precision/shapes | low compute efficiency                | FP8/FP4, padding, fused kernels                  |
| CPU-GPU transfers are costly                  | dataloader stalls GPU                 | pinned memory, async copy, prefetch              |
| distributed collectives create bubbles        | scaling efficiency drops              | overlap communication and computation            |

## Hardware-Software-Algorithm Codesign

Chapter 1 frames modern AI performance as a **codesign problem**.

    classDef hw fill:#eef6ff,stroke:#2563eb,color:#0f172a
    classDef sw fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b
    classDef alg fill:#fff7ed,stroke:#ea580c,color:#7c2d12
    classDef result fill:#f5f3ff,stroke:#7c3aed,color:#2e1065

    HW[Hardware<br/>GPU, HBM, NVLink, RDMA, Storage]:::hw
    SW[Software<br/>CUDA, PyTorch, NCCL, Runtime, Scheduler]:::sw
    ALG[Algorithm<br/>Attention, MoE, Quantization, Batching]:::alg

    R[High Goodput<br/>Low Latency<br/>Lower Cost]:::result

    HW <--> SW
    SW <--> ALG
    ALG <--> HW

    HW --> R
    SW --> R
    ALG --> R
```

A performance issue can often be solved at different layers.

Example: inference latency is too high.

| Layer       | Possible Fix                       | Trade-off                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Hardware    | Use B200/H200 instead of A100/H100 | expensive                    |
| Precision   | FP8/FP4 quantization               | possible accuracy loss       |
| Kernel      | optimized attention kernel         | engineering complexity       |
| Runtime     | CUDA Graphs                        | shape/static constraints     |
| Serving     | continuous batching                | latency-throughput trade-off |
| Application | prompt compression                 | possible quality loss        |
| Scheduler   | route long prompts separately      | operational complexity       |

The senior engineer’s question is:

```text
Which layer gives the highest ROI fix for this bottleneck?
```

## DeepSeek Case Study

Chapter 1 uses DeepSeek as a motivating case.

The lesson is not simply that “DeepSeek used fewer GPUs.”

The deeper performance engineering lesson is:

> When hardware is constrained, software and algorithmic optimization become strategic weapons.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef constraint fill:#fff1f2,stroke:#e11d48,color:#7f1d1d
    classDef technique fill:#eef6ff,stroke:#2563eb,color:#0f172a

    C1[Restricted GPU access<br/>H800 instead of top-tier GPUs]:::constraint
    C2[Lower interconnect bandwidth]:::constraint
    C3[Large MoE model scale]:::constraint

    T1[Custom kernels]:::technique
    T2[Communication/computation overlap]:::technique
    T3[MoE sparse activation]:::technique
    T4[Distillation / RL strategy]:::technique

    O[High model capability<br/>Lower training cost<br/>Better ROI]:::outcome

    C1 --> T1
    C2 --> T2
    C3 --> T3
    T1 --> O
    T2 --> O
    T3 --> O
    T4 --> O
```

Key lessons:

| Constraint                         | Engineering Response                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| limited GPU interconnect bandwidth | reduce and overlap communication         |
| limited hardware availability      | optimize kernels and runtime             |
| large model size                   | use MoE sparse activation                |
| high training cost                 | improve algorithmic efficiency           |
| inference cost pressure            | optimize attention and KV cache behavior |

For your DGX B200/H100 context, the same lesson applies:

```text
Do not assume that more GPU is the first answer.
First prove whether the bottleneck is compute, memory, network, storage, runtime, or scheduling.
```

## Performance Bottleneck Lens

## Chapter Summary

Chapter 1 gives the operating philosophy of the whole book.

The chapter’s main message:

> AI systems performance engineering is full-stack, empirical, and goodput-driven.

Important takeaways:

1. GPU utilization alone is not enough.
2. Goodput is the meaningful performance target.
3. Bottlenecks can appear in GPU, CPU, memory, network, storage, runtime, scheduler, or application layers.
4. Performance optimization must be profile-driven.
5. DeepSeek shows that smart engineering can offset hardware constraints.
6. Mechanical sympathy means designing software and algorithms around hardware realities.
7. Hardware, software, and algorithms must be codesigned.
8. Reproducibility matters because performance claims without repeatable benchmarks are weak.
9. At AI scale, small efficiency improvements can translate into large cost savings.
10. The job of an AI Systems Performance Engineer is to turn expensive raw compute into useful model progress.

## Answers

1. **Throughput** is total processed work per time. **Goodput** is useful completed work per time, excluding waits, restarts, stalls, and overhead.

2. GPU utilization only says the GPU is active. It does not prove that the GPU is doing useful model progress. A GPU can be busy with inefficient kernels, memory movement, or synchronization overhead.

3. The role optimizes end-to-end AI workload performance across hardware, software, algorithms, runtime, network, storage, and scheduler layers.

4. Mechanical sympathy means understanding the hardware’s actual behavior and designing software/algorithms that exploit its strengths and avoid its weaknesses.

5. Because performance claims are meaningless unless they can be repeated, compared, and validated with the same workload, environment, and metrics.

6. Possible causes: NCCL wait, memory-bound kernels, small batch size, dataloader stalls, storage jitter, CPU NUMA issues, synchronization bubbles.

7. Check NCCL bandwidth, all-reduce time, step time breakdown, GPU/NIC topology, RDMA counters, NVLink/NVSwitch usage, and straggler behavior.

8. Inspect queue time, request length distribution, batch size, KV cache usage, prefill/decode split, TTFT, TPOT, and scheduler policy.

9. Checkpoint I/O, storage bandwidth, filesystem latency, or distributed synchronization may be responsible.

10. High TTFT usually points to the prefill phase, prompt processing, scheduling queue, or long input context bottleneck.

11. Because bad placement can put GPUs, NICs, and CPU threads across inefficient topology paths, increasing NCCL latency and reducing goodput.

12. Use Nsight Systems for timeline and NCCL overlap, Nsight Compute for kernel-level compute/memory analysis, and NCCL tests for network baseline.

13. Measure before/after samples/sec or tokens/sec, dataloader wait time, GPU idle time, CPU utilization, and repeat the benchmark under the same conditions.

14. When profiling shows the bottleneck is memory movement, communication, attention complexity, batching policy, or KV cache behavior rather than raw compute capacity.

15. Workload definition, fixed input shape/data, hardware/software versions, baseline metric, acceptable threshold, profiler artifact, and automated comparison.
